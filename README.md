# MK4I Swerve Code

  Parts Needed:
    - 4 Modules MK4I
    
    - Pigeon 2.0
    
    - 4 Can Coders (Absolute magnet Encoders for steering)
    
    - 8 neo Motors
    
    - 8 Spark Maxes

  Step by Step Swerve Tuning Instructions:

    -find azimuth angle offsets based of the abosulute angle

    -tune azimuth position control(ff + PD) for quick, accurate alignment without oscillation (ff is helpful when using profiled control)

    -check wheel odometry is accurate

    -tune drive wheel velocity control(ff + P)
    
    -tune path controller P(D?) values
